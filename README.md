# Data-Cleaning-and-Visualizations-using-Python

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The API is about leading causes of death by sex and ethnicity in New York City in since 2007. Cause of death is derived from the NYC death certificate which is issued for every death that occurs in New York City. This dataset contains the cause for death, the race of people , the death rate and the year of deaths with respect to the type of disease and race. Ahead we will clean the data and perform some analysis and insights with the help of visualizations.
A single open source API was chosen for this project from https://www.data.gov.
The objective of this task is to collect a dataset from one or more open web APIs of your choice, and use Python to preprocess and analyse the collected data. We will also use Visualisations to find insights and summarize the results as seen below.</p>
